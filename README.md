# Classes-and-Objects

Using the skeleton of the class Student, I added some attributes to the Student class which are below;

Name: A string, which was initialized when creating an instance of Student
Age: An integer, which was initialized when creating an instance of Student
Tracks: A list of strings, which was initialized when creating an instance of Student.
Score: A float, which was initialized when creating an instance of Student.    

I also created the following methods for class “Student”:

change_name: I changed the student's name, which accepts a new name as an argument.
Change_age: I changed the student's age, which accepts a new age as an argument and ensures that age remains an integer.
Add_track: I added a new item to student's tracks, which accepts a new track as an argument.
get_score: I returned student’s score.
